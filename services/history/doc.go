// The workflow history is a detailed, complete, and consistent record of every event that
// occurred since the workflow execution started.
//
// The workflow history contains every event that causes the execution state of the
// workflow execution to change, such as scheduled and completed activities, task
// timeouts, and signals.
//
// Operations that do not change the state of the workflow execution do not typically
// appear in the workflow history.
